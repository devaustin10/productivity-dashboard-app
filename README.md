- Build Tool: Maven
- Verison Control: Git/Github
  - Workflow: Feature Branch Workflow (continous delivery & integration)Â 
- Dockerize Application: Docker Container for the whole application, write DockerFile to create image - setup/post
- API: (TBD) - add things to help us that are too difficult to do on our own 
- Project Management Tool: GitHub Projects


POSSIBLE TECH STACK SIMPLIFICATION SWITCH
- PETITE + FIRE Stack
- REACT/FIREBASE

### Step One

- Research:
    openId Connect
    Docker 
    

Mission Statement/ Vision statement
- One stop shop to track productivity, organize your day, and track personal progress

Generalized Challenges
- OpenId Connect for every feature
- 

What is the application?
- A dashboard app that has CRUD widgets - clock, claender, tasks, time per task...
- user accounts - with unique dashboard
- teams feature with permissions (roles) granted to users
- integrates google connet and also our own developed widgets (ex. pomodoro)

What do you want in the dashboard?
- planner aplication that tracks what you do -> simple no openid Connect, but has all the links for the widgets you use
- A mix of both-> the most used widgets would connect (calender: google calender),  genreal music(no options)
- Impliment one open id connect to create user profile but also provide linking to calender and other google services.

Why is this application usefull?
- An everyday application to combine other applications into one
- it is customizable to users but also provides gnereal team use 

Who would use the application?
- incoming dev10 associates -> provide utility use
- Dev10 asociates -> provides purpose and personal connection -> it is motivating 

What do you have open when you start your day? -> connect all of these into one dashboard
MH:  Spotify,  google, teams, outlook
LK:  Google calander, outlook,  big brain keeps it all up top,  Youtube music
LC:  Chat features (discord), calender, spotify, notes
AK:  Outlook, gmail, teams, sound cloud, pomodoro, many chrome tabs open, github, notes, reminders, calender - as todo list

How do we make this applicaiton flexible??
